# Retail Sales Analysis

# Problem Statement

Retail businesses face challenges in understanding customer behavior, optimizing inventory, and increasing sales efficiency. Without proper data analysis, companies struggle to:

Identify Sales Trends – Understanding which products sell best and when.

Analyze Customer Behavior – Recognizing purchasing patterns based on demographics.

Optimize Pricing Strategies – Ensuring competitive pricing to maximize revenue.

Improve Inventory Management – Stocking the right products based on demand.

Enhance Marketing Strategies – Targeting customers effectively to boost sales.

This project aims to address these challenges by analyzing sales data, customer demographics, and time-based trends to provide actionable insights for business growth.
